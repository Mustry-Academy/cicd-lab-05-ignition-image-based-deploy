# Lab 05 — Ignition image-based deploy

Day 3 of the [CI/CD for Ignition Masterclass](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-masterclass).

> Bake an Ignition gateway's project, config, **and modules** into a versioned Docker image, push it to a registry, and deploy by pulling the image and recreating the container — then promote the *exact same image* you tested on the test gateway to production on a tag, with rollback as easy as running a previous tag.

This is the companion to [Lab 04 (file-based deploy)](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-04-ignition-file-based-deploy). There you `docker cp`-ed files into a *running* gateway and triggered a hot scan — fast, great for daily project iteration, but it couldn't touch modules (a scan can't enable/disable them) and gave you no versioned, rollback-able artifact. Image-based deploy is the other half: the deployable state becomes an immutable image. Most mature Ignition workflows use **both** — file-based for the inner loop, image-based for releases.

## What changes from Lab 04

| | Lab 04 (file-based) | Lab 05 (image-based) |
|---|---|---|
| Unit of deploy | Files on disk | A versioned image |
| Mechanism | `docker cp` + hot scan | `docker pull` + recreate container |
| Modules | Can't ship (scan won't apply) | Baked into the image |
| Rollback | Re-deploy old files | Run the previous tag |
| Promotion | Re-copy per environment | Re-tag the tested image |
| Where it shines | Active development | Immutable releases |

The local → test → production story is the same; only the test/production **delivery mechanism** changes.

## Prerequisites

- **≥ 8 GB free RAM for Docker** — three Ignition gateways at 1 GB each, plus TimescaleDB and Docker overhead.
- _Optional, for the stretch challenge only:_ a fork of this repo. The CI builds publish images to **your own** GHCR namespace (`ghcr.io/<your-fork-owner>/cicd-lab-05-ignition`) — never to Mustry's. **Enable Actions in your fork first**: forks ship with workflows disabled — open the *Actions* tab and click the green "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" button. The lab itself needs no fork, no PAT, and no GitHub account.
- _Background:_ [Lab 04](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-04-ignition-file-based-deploy) sets up the Ignition stack and the file-based pattern this lab contrasts with. It helps but isn't required — this lab stands alone.
- _No extra registry account:_ the CI publishes to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** under your fork, authenticated with the workflow's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The **local** scripts (`build-image.sh`/`deploy-image.sh`) need no registry at all — they build and run images on your machine.


> **WSL2 (Windows): keep the clone in your Linux home (`~/…`), never `/mnt/c/…`.**
> On the Windows filesystem your Windows user, your WSL user and the gateway's
> container user are three different identities, so file ownership breaks in ways
> `chown` cannot fix and you end up reaching for `sudo` (which makes it worse).
> `scripts/setup.sh` refuses to run from there, and never needs `sudo`.
> See [`docs/wsl-setup.md`](./docs/wsl-setup.md).

## Quick start

```bash
gh repo clone mustry-academy/cicd-lab-05-ignition-image-based-deploy
cd cicd-lab-05-ignition-image-based-deploy
cp .env.example .env
scripts/setup.sh    # brings up the stack, waits for all three gateways, prints credentials
```

Once setup finishes you have three Ignition gateways:

| Gateway | URL | What runs there |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | http://localhost:8088 | Bind-mounted from `./projects/` + `./services/config/` — your **authoring** gateway (file-based, like Lab 04). |
| `test` | http://localhost:8089 | The **image** `deploy.yml` builds on push to **`main`**. Base image (empty) until the first deploy. |
| `production` | http://localhost:8090 | The **image** `release.yml` promotes on tag push `v*` (cut from `main`). Base image (empty) until the first release. |

Login with the credentials from `.env` (`GATEWAY_ADMIN_USERNAME_LOCAL/_TEST/_PRODUCTION`, default `admin / password`).

> **Trial mode:** each gateway runs in 2-hour trial mode. Reset via *Gateway → Config → Licensing → Reset Trial* — unlimited and legal for development. Note: because test/production are recreated from a fresh image on each deploy, their trial clock resets every deploy too.

> **Stuck?** See [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Before opening a PR, run `scripts/validate.sh` (mirrors CI) and `scripts/build-image.sh` (confirms the image builds).

## Lab structure

The lab is one exercise in two ordered parts — see [`exercises/lab.md`](./exercises/lab.md):

1. **Build the gateway image** — bake projects, config, and modules into a self-contained image.
2. **Deploy the image** — recreate the test gateway from it, ship a change end-to-end, roll back.

Reference reading sits alongside: [`docs/dockerfile-anatomy.md`](./docs/dockerfile-anatomy.md) (part 1) and [`docs/image-based-deploy-pattern.md`](./docs/image-based-deploy-pattern.md) (part 2).

## The Compose stack

Three Ignition 8.3 gateways + one TimescaleDB, simulating local → test → production:

- **`ignition-local`** bind-mounts `./projects/` and `./services/config/`, exactly like Lab 04. This is where you **author** content. The image you ship is *built from these same files*.
- **`ignition-test`** runs whatever image `IGNITION_TEST_IMAGE` points at (default: the base Ignition image — an empty gateway). It has **no bind mounts and no persistent data volume** — the container filesystem *is* the artifact. `deploy.yml` sets `IGNITION_TEST_IMAGE` to the freshly built tag and recreates the container.
- **`ignition-production`** is the same shape, fed by `release.yml` with the *promoted* image (the same one the test gateway tested).

The single TimescaleDB hosts `ignition_local_development`/`ignition_test`/`ignition_production`. **Historian data lives in Timescale, not in the gateway image** — which is exactly why throwing away and recreating the test/production container on every deploy is safe.

`name: cicd-lab05` at the top of the compose file pins the project name so the stack always resolves to *these* containers, whichever directory you run compose from, instead of spinning up a parallel set under a directory-derived name.

## Branching model (GitHub flow)

This lab uses **GitHub flow**: one long-lived branch, releases cut by tagging — the same flow as every previous lab.

```
feature/*  ──PR→  main ──push→  deploy.yml ──build+push→ :test image ──→ TEST gateway
                   │
                   └─tag vX.Y.Z→  release.yml ──promote :test→ :vX.Y.Z+:production ──→ PRODUCTION gateway
```

| Branch | Role | What CI does |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | The only long-lived branch — every merge should be deployable | `deploy.yml` builds the image and ships it to the **test** gateway |
| `feature/*` | Day-to-day work, branched off `main` | `ci.yml` validates the PR into `main` |
| tag `vX.Y.Z` | A release — stamp the `main` state you want in production | `release.yml` promotes the tested image to **production** |

**Releasing is promotion, not a rebuild.** `release.yml` promotes **the image test already
tested** — the `:test` tag — re-tagging it to `:vX.Y.Z` + `:production`. Production runs the exact digest test
validated; rebuilding from the tagged commit could silently pull a newer base layer and ship bytes
test never ran. Tag when test is where you want production to be.

## The CI/CD workflows

Three workflows under [`.github/workflows/`](./.github/workflows/):

| File | Trigger | Runner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) | PR to `main` | `ubuntu-latest` | Validate JSON + `.dockerignore`, lint the Dockerfile (hadolint) and workflows (actionlint), and **build the image** (no push) so a broken Dockerfile fails the PR. |
| [`deploy.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) | Push to `main` (build paths), manual | `ubuntu-latest` | Build + push the image to GHCR (`:sha-<short>`, `:test`) and print the tag in the run summary. |
| [`release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml) | Tag `v*` (on `main`), manual | `ubuntu-latest` | Re-tag the **`:test`** image (what the test gateway is running) to `:vX.Y.Z` + `:production` (**no rebuild**) and print the tag. |

**Every workflow runs on a free GitHub-hosted runner** — this lab stands up no self-hosted runner at all. Notice what that means: CI can build and promote images, but it cannot *deploy* one, because deploying means touching a machine that owns a gateway container. So in this lab **you deploy by hand**: take the image name the workflow printed, put it in `IGNITION_TEST_IMAGE`, and run `docker compose up -d ignition-test` yourself.

That division is the point. The build half is portable and cheap; the last mile needs a privileged runner sitting next to the gateway. Labs 06 and 07 add that runner — here you play its part manually, so you can see exactly what it will be doing for you.

### GHCR auth and environments

- The build/promote jobs push to **your own fork's** namespace — the workflows derive `ghcr.io/<owner>/cicd-lab-05-ignition` from `github.repository_owner`, so a student's fork publishes under *their* account, not Mustry's. No image ever pushes to a registry you don't own.
- Auth is the workflow's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (the workflows request `packages: write`). No registry password in `.env`, no extra account.
- The first push creates a GHCR package under your namespace. It defaults to **private** — so to pull it by hand you need to `docker login ghcr.io` once (username = your GitHub user, password = a `repo`+`read:packages` token), or flip the package to public in its settings.
- If your fork lives under a GitHub **organization**, the org may restrict this: *Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions* must allow **read and write**, and Packages must be enabled. A 403 on push almost always traces back to one of these — see [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
- **No GHCR needed for the lab exercises** — the local `build-image.sh`/`deploy-image.sh` flow runs entirely on your machine. GHCR only enters via the CI workflows.

No GitHub **environments** are needed here, since nothing deploys from CI. When you do wire up a deploy job (Lab 06/07), putting it behind an environment is what gives you per-stage history and **required reviewers** as an approval gate before production.

Part 2 of [`exercises/lab.md`](./exercises/lab.md) walks through the deploy flow by hand — the flow a pipeline will eventually automate for you.
